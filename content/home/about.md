# Biography

I am a med school student who formerly studied neuroscience and genome bioinformatics at KAIST. I am currently interested in reinforcement learning itself, and how our brain encodes those informations. Psychiatric disorders which I am interested in are developmental disorders such as autism, ADHD.
